4. find the critical piece of implementation
    * write comments as you go
5. read randomly to achieve deep understanding 
    * follow function calls
    * jump around
    * read existing code for context
    * Every line of code is a puzzle piece
    * often read the same line of code 3, 4, 5 times 
6. read class by class
    * make up unit tests as you go
    * ensure up edge cases are covered when reading tests
