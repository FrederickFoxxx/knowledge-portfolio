# Interfaces 

Set of command behaviours to be used by different classes. Interface sets up a contract for what methods and return types a class would have. Decoupling the what from how. 

* All methods and variables are automatically public and abstract
* All code written in the class that implements the interface
* gives an idea of what will be done, not how it will be done
* a class can implement any number of interfaces  


* since java 8  `default` methods with implementations
* since java 9 interfaces can contain private methods commonly used when two default methods in an interface share common code.
