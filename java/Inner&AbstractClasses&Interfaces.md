# Interfaces

Set of command behaviours to be used by different classes. Interface sets up a contract for what methods and return types a class would have.
* All methods and variables are automatically public 
* All code written in the class that implements the interface
* gives an idea of what will be done, not how it will be done 


# Abstract Classes
* Methods can have any visibility
* Abstract classes may contain abstract declarations, concrete implementations or both. 
* can have constructor
* useful if one method's implementation is a shared between many classes, but one needs to different.
