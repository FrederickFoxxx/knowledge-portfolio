Host: example.com   <- Headers

##Â Headers

Every request and response have headers to send extra data.
* Key value pairs
* aren't case sensitive

**Different kinds of headers**

* Describe the body
```
content-type: image/png
content-length: 1234
content-encoding: gzip
content-language: es-ES
```
* Ask for specific kind of response
* Manage Caches
* say where request comes from
* cookies

## Request Lifecycle

**1. Local Processing**

* browser extracts scheme / protocol i.e hostname and http
```
<protcol>://<host><:optional port><path/to/resource><?query params>
```

* with the hostname now needs to resolve the IP address. Will check local browser cache, OS cache of recent queries, and DNS cache

**2. Resolve an IP**
* Browser fires DNS request using User Datagram Protocol UDP
*
