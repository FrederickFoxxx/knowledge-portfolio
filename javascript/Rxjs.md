# RxJs

- handling async with single api.
- DOM / ajax / Interval - same api.
- produce events over time

## Concepts
### Observable 
- collection of events over time
- closed success or errors
- closed observables cannot emit any more
### Observer 
- subscribes to an observable
- listens to events being emitted

### Operators
