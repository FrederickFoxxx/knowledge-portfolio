# 1. A Tour of Computer Systems

Source program (file) e.g. hello.c
*text file* sequence of bytes, ASCII characters

**All information in a system - including disk files, programs stored in memory, user data stored in memory and data transferred across a network - is represented as a bunch of bits** Only distinguished by the context in which we view them. 

translated into executable object program (binary disk file). 4 phases - preprocessor -> compiler -> Assembler -> linker (known as compilation system)

* Preprocessing phase. modifies orginal program according directives that begin with '#'. result another Program with suffix .i
* Compilation phase. translates the text file hello.i into text file hello.s. assembly-language program. useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers. definition of fuction *main*
* Assembly phase.  .s translated into machine language, relocatable objcet program. .o suffix, would appear as jibberish
* Linking phase. merges functions contained in the standard C library
