# 1. A Tour of Computer Systems

Source program (file) e.g. hello.c
*text file* sequence of bytes, ASCII characters

**All information in a system - including disk files, programs stored in memory, user data stored in memory and data transferred across a network - is represented as a bunch of bits** Only distinguished by the context in which we view them. 

translated into executable object program (binary disk file). 4 phases - preprocessor -> compiler -> Assembler -> linker (known as compilation system)

* Preprocessing phase. modifies orginal program according directives that begin with '#'. result another Program with suffix .i
* Compilation phase. translates the text file hello.i into text file hello.s. assembly-language program. useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers. definition of fuction *main*
* Assembly phase.  .s translated into machine language, relocatable objcet program. .o suffix, would appear as jibberish
* Linking phase. merges functions contained in the standard C library

1.3 It pays to understand how compilation works

* Optimizing performance
* Understanding link-time errors
* Avoiding security holes

1.4

**buses** carry bytes back and forth between components. designed to transfer fixed size chunks, known as *words*

**I/O devices** connection to external world eg. mouse & keyboard

**Main Memory** holds the program and the data it manipulates.

**Processor** the engine that interprets (executes) instructions stored in main memory. contains *program counter* (PC) - a word-size storage unit that points at some machine language instruction in the main memory. *arithmetic/logic unit* (ALU) computes new data and address values.

simple operations a processor might carry out
* Load - Copy byte or word from main memory into register√•, overwriting contents
* Store - Copy from register to location in main memory overwriting contents
* Operate - copy the contents of 2 ALU registers to perform arithmetic operation.
* Jump - extract a word from the instruction itself and copy word into program counter, overwritng previous value of the PC.
